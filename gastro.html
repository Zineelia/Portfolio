              This was a rapid prototyping challenge for 24 hours. There were
              several challenges that we could focus on and many teams that took
              part. My team focused on tourists and local people, enhancing
              their interest in local stores in Salzburg, and trying to find
              solutions that would help support the local stores.

            <p>
              My team consisted of six people and in the end, we won an award
              for the most technologically advanced solution. Our Prototype
              included AR exampels, that were fully functioning. As the
              Hackathon took place close to winter our app theme and concept was
              Christmas!
